    <h1>Kürtöskalács (Chimney Cake)</h1>
    <p>I saw an oven for the first time when I was in Sweden, my mom had never baked a single thing. I thus grew up in a house where baking was an unknown art. The first real thing I baked was banana bread with help of one of our family friend. Because hubby loves banana bread, I ventured into baking bread; and my first bread was a brick, very thick, and not edible. After years of doing very mistake possible and rectifying them the yeast and me are friends, we like each others companion. I thus joined “Daring Bakers Challenge” in 2009. It has helped me to learn lot of new dishes and techniques. Today I am proud to host this month “Daring Bakers Challenge”, and for this I choose two recipes, chimney cake or Kürtőskalács, other is Ensaimda.
