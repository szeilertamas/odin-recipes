# Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course aimed at practicing HTML skills by building a basic recipe website.

## Introduction

In this project, you will build a simple recipe website consisting of a main index page linking to various recipes. The focus is on strengthening your HTML knowledge, with styling to be added later.

## Setting up the Project

Follow these steps to set up the project's GitHub repository:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named "odin-recipes" and set it to public.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using SSH: `git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git`
3. Navigate into the `odin-recipes` directory.

## Assignment

### Iteration 1: Initial Structure
- Create an `index.html` file within the `odin-recipes` directory.
- Add the basic HTML boilerplate and include an `<h1>` heading with the text "Odin Recipes".

### Iteration 2: Recipe Page
- Create a new directory named `recipes` within the `odin-recipes` directory.
- Inside the `recipes` directory, create HTML files for each recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`) and add an `<h1>` heading with the recipe's name.
- Link to the recipe pages from the `index.html` file.

### Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
- Each recipe page should include:
  - An image of the dish.
  - Description of the recipe.
  - List of ingredients.
  - List of steps to make the dish.

### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
- Add two additional recipes with the same structure as the initial recipe.
- Link to the new recipes on the index page, preferably using an unordered list.

## Viewing the Project Online

To showcase your work or submit it for review, you can publish the project on GitHub Pages. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure the main HTML file is named `index.html`.
2. On GitHub, go to your repository's Settings.
3. In the Settings, navigate to Pages.
4. Set the Branch to `main` and save.
5. Your project will be accessible at `https://your-github-username.github.io/odin-recipes`.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to reinforce HTML skills and provide a foundation for future styling and development. Focus on completing the iterations and adhere to best practices in version control.
